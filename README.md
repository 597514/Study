# Study
First, navigate to the folder containing your project using the cd command. Initialize a new Git repository using the git init command. Add all the files and folders in your project to the repository using the git add . command. Commit the changes using the git commit -m "Initial commit" command. Create a new repository on GitHub. Add the remote repository URL to your local repository using the git remote add origin <remote_url> command, replacing <remote_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository. Push the changes to GitHub using the git push -u origin master command.

By the way, all of the stuff above is literally only for new respositories and its also to just push huge files and folders inside a respository.

Clone the repository: First, you need to clone the existing repository to your local machine. Open Git CMD or Git Bash and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the command git clone <repository_url>, replacing <repository_url> with the URL of the existing repository on GitHub. Make changes: Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the cloned repository using the cd command. Make the necessary changes to the files in the repository using your preferred text editor or IDE. Stage the changes: Use the command git add . to stage all the changes you made in the repository. This command adds the modified files to the staging area in preparation for the commit. Commit the changes: Run the command git commit -m "Your commit message" to create a new commit with the staged changes. Replace "Your commit message" with a descriptive message that explains the changes you made in this commit. Push the changes: Finally, use the command git push origin master to push the commits from your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. This command pushes the changes to the master branch of the remote repository.

The stuff above me NOW is only to commit your newly edited files into GitHub.
